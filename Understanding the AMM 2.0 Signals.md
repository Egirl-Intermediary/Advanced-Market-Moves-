Introduction to the Arrows
There are three core components in AMM 2.0. The RSI (Relative Strength Index), the Bollinger Bands, and the fast version of the original MACD. If you notice, there are 2 labels on your chart that says "Signal 1" and "Signal 2". The color of the label correspond to the color of the arrow.

Let's talk about Signal 1:
Bullish Signal 1 gets generated when the RSI is Oversold and the candle closes above the lower Bollinger Band
Bearish Signal 1 gets generated when the RSI is Overbought and the candle closes below the upper Bollinger Band
Now, moving on to Signal 2:
Bullish Signal 2 gets generated when the RSI is Oversold and there is a bullish crossover on the MACD
Bearish Signal 2 gets generated when the RSI is Overbought and there is a bearish crossover on the MACD
There is also an option called Old Signal. This uses the same RSI concept but with price crossing above and below the 5 simple moving average.

Trading Strategy
This is the second most asked question. Again, totally fair to ask. This is what I'm here for. You guys want to know the strategy to use, the timeframe to use, etc.

I think the answer would be up to you as the trader, your risk tolerance, and your trading style. Now that you understand how the indicator works, I think it's best that you go through different timeframes and see which one works best for you. The good thing about AMM 2.0 is that it does not repaint. You can easily check the old signals and do backtesting on them.

I personally use AMM 2.0 on the hourly and daily timeframe. As they always say, the bigger the timeframe, the bigger the move. But that does not mean it doesn't work for day trading. Pairing the indicator up with basic Support and Resistance lines will help. That's what I would suggest as well. Looking for potential areas where price may bounce or resist.

There is NO holy grail
I think we must all come to a realization that AMM 2.0 is not the holy grail; nothing is when it comes to trading and indicators.

I recommend everyone to test drive it on different timeframes and develop a strategy around it. Always have a stop loss in place in case the trade doesn't work out.
